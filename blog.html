                      <p>The past few decades has been great for the world of technolgy in the human history. From creating an app which connected millions
                          of people to creating virtual asstiatnace to getting the first evidence of the most powerful substance in existence. 
                        The human kind has been using and developing advanced technologies since one can remember. It has become a part of our life. Especially the younger
                        generation whether it is looking into the phone as soon as you wake up or booking the tickets for the next show. These technology is
                        created with the sole purpose of benefiting mankind and the world. With every innovation of technology created or is being created as we speak and every moment 
                        passing , we are taking one step forward(or getting deeper into the modern world we've created) to the world of technology.

                        <p> What if we could could capture the images through our eyes, what if we could erase the entire memory of a person. These 
                            whatifs lead to a show on netflix called " Black Mirror ". The show is basically based on a distopian future where people
                            living in that period uses various kind of gadget such as a memory-erasing headband, robotic-dogs, robotic bees, AI that 
                            simulates dead people etc. Though the sow is quiet abstract, what makes it so unsettling
                            is that its episodes takes place in worlds that could easily pass for our own.<br><br>
                            
                            When NASA first announced about the robotic bees or drone bees I couldn't help but think about the robotic-bees from 
                            the show.The purpose of these robotic bees was to pollinate plants incase of insect apocalyspe. In the show, the robotic bees were programmed in such a way that they could use 3D-printing to create hives
                            and replicate themselves. They were also equiped with facial recognition capabilties and tiny spy cameras that
                            helps the government check up against potential crimes. Unfortunately, these are hacked and is used to carryout
                            crimes. NASA invented these with the same purpose as the show and I couldnl't imagine further.

                            Social media is the technolgy that has connected millions of people around the world. It is the great space to
                            express one's views, explore about the current topics and learn new things. It can be used in business purposes
                            to promote business or oneself. People use it as source of entertainment, news or a medium to connect to the
                            outer world. Social media is definitly that source and privilege that we can use to effectively share our views, learn
                            new things and educate who are lagging behind on views regardless any culture or religion. Either one can take social media as a place to do so or
                            simply make a place for society's insatiable thirst of distraction. There are lots of not-so positive 
                            aspects of it but for now, it is inclined more towards the positive.
                            side.
